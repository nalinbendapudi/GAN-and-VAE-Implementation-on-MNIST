# Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational AutoEncoders on MNIST dataset

Implementations include:
- Standard VAE
- Conditional VAE
- FC GAN (Fully-connected GAN)
- DC GAN (Deep-convoluted GAN)
- LS GAN (Least-squares GAN)

Classes and functions are implemented in they python files. Run the `.ipynb` file to run the code
